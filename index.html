        <div class="recipe">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 extra large egg whites</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>3 cups unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350&#176;F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, stir all of the ingredients except the chocolate chips until fully mixed. Let the mixture sit for 3 minutes.
                Stir again. Add the chocolate chips and stir to mix well. Using a 1/3-cup ice-cream scoop, place eight or nine mounds on each
                prepared baking sheet. Flatten each macaroon, using clean, damp fingers.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 minutes and rotate the pans for even baking. Bake for 6 minutes more for a deep golden toasted color, or 8 minutes
                more for a darker, crunchy macaroon.</li>
            <li>Let cool on the parchment. You will have to peel the cookies from the parchment when they are cooled, but they will come off.
                Transfer to a rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight tin with parchment between the layers.</li>
        </ol>
